> Why does this project exist? Simply because I would like to have all the information in one place rather than jumping around from list to list.
> 
>  The Tor and Piracy list are for research purposes only, I do not take any responsibility for any damages. These lists should be used with caution. If you are not sure whether you should go to the darknet (Tor), do not do it. Educate yourself on this subject and do not click on random links.
